# Development Process

The application is developed using modified Feature model behind homologation and production Environments. 

The application is developed focused on features implementations and building new features. 

Continuous tests are performed focused on link quality and performance.

Sprints based on priority first :

1 -  [ Feature ] . [ Production ] . [ Test ]    ---> First Feature
 
2 - [ Test ] . [ Solve Issue ] . [ Production ]  ---> First Test

2 - [ Collect Data ] . [ Test ] . [ Produce value ]  ---> First Collect Data

# Microservices consummation

## Ticapsoriginal Basic Mobile development ( will not be used ) : 

* Tested [`flutter webview`](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) 
* Tested [`iOS webview`](https://github.com/Tinoco/Gameiios-main)
* Considered [`Caddy Multiplataform Strategy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)

    * Context, Solutions and Problem Statement: Webview is simple and easy to develop, generic to any web application rendering and Caddy expands range considerably but loses performance and necessarily only works online, are strategically strong options in range, but considerably allocated and dependent on the server side.
  

## Ticapsoriginal Native Mobile app development :

* Android : preparing [`Cupertino interface`](https://pub.dev/packages?q=cupertino)
* iOS : preparing [`Uitableview`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableview), [`Realm db`](https://realm.io) and [`UrlSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiondelegate) if need http layers protocols

     * Context, Solutions and Problem Statement: Ticapsoriginal mainly revolves around the search page, result page and database. This boils down nicely to a UitableView, a View and a remote or local Database. Statefull components work in a similar way. Cupertino's interface can facilitate a seamless transition between Android and iOS. Efforts on mobile can be directed towards not relying on online data or just for synchronous updating.
